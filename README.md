# gNmap (go Network Mapper)

A tiny Network mapper for go learning purposes and fun!

- It's obviously inspired in Nmap, but it's not going to be 100% compatible
- The project is aimed for golang learning purposes
- My initial idea is to support a couple of host discovery/port scanning techniques (See [TODO](#TODO))

## TODO

[Host discovery](https://nmap.org/book/man-host-discovery.html) support
  - [ ] TCP SYN/ACK,
  - [ ] UDP,
  - [ ] ICMP probes
  - [ ] ARP

[Scanning techniques](https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html)
  - [ ] TCP
  - [ ] UDP


- [ ] Multiple targets support
- [ ] JSON Output
